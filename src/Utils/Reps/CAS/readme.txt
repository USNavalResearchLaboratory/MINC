This code makes use of the computer algebra system Oscar to
construct matrix representations for the dihedral/cyclic group;
we convert Oscars types to Julia base arrays and save
the files for loading by MINC without acruing an
Oscar dependency.

See the project/manifest tomls for versions of Oscar that functions
with the CAS/src code.
